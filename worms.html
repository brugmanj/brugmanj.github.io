<h1>Tracking the speed of C. Elegans Mutants</h1>
<h4><i>*This projects results are anonymized until it has been published.</i></h4>

<h2>Problem:</h2>
<p>Current tracking system (The Multi Worm Tracker) is not confirming that which has been observed. There was seen to be a difference in movement between certain C. Elegans mutations and their normal non-mutated state (wild-type worms). This is mainly due to the current tracker looking for movement, and not the cessation of movement, which was observed. By utilizing OpenCV, Convoluted Neural Networks, Yolo and SSD object detection, and centroid tracking, I will design a worm tracker to look for cessation of movement to either confirm or deny this observation. As a secondary problem I decided I would try and predict which mutation we were given just by analyzing the video. This would be useful if a plate of worms was ever unlabeled, we could just run a video analysis on the worms to see which mutation we most likely have.</p>
